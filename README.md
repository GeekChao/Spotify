# Spotify :guitar:

This is a clone of Spotify client built with react and redux. See [Demo]( https://kevinzou.herokuapp.com/) at here.<br/>
This app plays around with Spotify web api and playback sdk. <br/>
**Caveat**: Safari doesn't support playback sdk. If you want to play tracks, use other browses instead.

* Naviagte through your own library and followed playlists
* Search songs related with albums, artists and tracks.
* Play tracks, forward and backward the track in the list.
* Adjust volume and show the progress of the playing track.
